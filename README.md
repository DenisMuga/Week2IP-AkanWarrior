##Description
his is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born - and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. For instance, a male born on Sunday is named “Kwasi” while a female born on Sunday is named ‘Akosua.’ Other days of the week such as Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday week have different Akan names too.
